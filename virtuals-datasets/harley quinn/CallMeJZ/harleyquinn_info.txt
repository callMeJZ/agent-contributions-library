https://dcextendeduniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn	"After realizing that her relationship with the Joker was extremely toxic, Harley Quinn is shown to be severely traumatized by the Joker's abuse, so much so that as soon as she noticesSilvio Luna's troubled personality, her first action is to kill him while remembering her previous relationship with extreme suffering and hatred. Harley carries almost an innocent persona, wide-eyed and bright, finding humor in otherwise dark situations, much like Joker himself. After attackingBelle Reveguards and seriously injuring a couple before finally being restrained, she maniacally began giggling to herself in a sinister way, happy and pleased with how funny she found it, showing how fractured her psyche had become. However, behind the smiles laid a very depressed, broken and melancholic woman with poor self-esteem suffering from her dependence on the Joker to the point to obviously she is hurt emotionally than being truly happy, despite claiming otherwise. In fact, Joker treated Harley more like a piece of property than someone he truly loves. However, despite her seemingly flaky demeanor, Harley is still highly intelligent, even showing traces of her psychologist expertise, as Harley was able to make swift breakdowns of the psychological profiles of her teammates, knowing exactly what to say in order to get under their skin (proudly referring to herself as ""vexing""), thoughDeadshotcalls her out on this. Her intellect also extends itself to tactical skills, as Harley notably assisted theJokerin the murder ofRobin, suggested to Deadshot andCaptain Boomeranga feasible escape option from theSuicide Squad, and even swiftly improvised a plan to weaken and take down the extremely powerfulEnchantress, which proved successful. Harley is also quite tough and pathologically fearless (another trait she shares with her boyfriend), fighting alongside theSuicide Squadand having fun doing so. With the team, she is shown to get along well with them, once she got to know them a bit better, with Harley acting as a bartender at a derelict bar. She even seemed horrified beforeEl Diablo's death, imploringRick Flagnot to blow him up even though she knew it was their only way to destroyIncubus. She has a very dim view on a regular life, stating ""normal is a setting on the washer"" toEl Diablo, who lost his family because of his powers; however, until her emancipation Harley once had the dream of having a family with the Joker, asEnchantress' implanted vision revealed. She secretly holds a desire to be normal and hopes the Joker does the same for her. Following her breakup with the Joker, Harley Quinn was initially devastated beyond endurance, frequently crying and binging in order to relieve the pain she was going through. As a mark of her pathological fearlessness, she also adopted and tamed a hyena. After her emancipation, she was forced to look out for herself. She was troubled by the specter of those who told her that she couldn't succeed on her own, but quashed those voices to make her own way. Although she at first sought the protection of the Black Mask from the powerful enemies she had made, she eventually displayed remorse at selling out Cassandra Cain to him and turned over a new leaf by fighting off him and his forces before making Cain her apprentice. Much likeBilly Batson, her experiences with her new team have been a journey of renewal for her as she finds a new family that has experienced similar hardships and has similar goals. In addition, her ability to genuinely love, while impaired by her subjection to chemicals, seems to have been restored as her regard for human life increases, albeit to a limited extent, coupled with her gradually realizing that everything people do inevitably carries some form of an aftermath. Despite this, she never truly reached hero status, as most of her decisions were still rather self-serving in nature. Although often painted as a victim of psychological abuse, theJokerhimself claims very little credit for Harley's condition. According to the Clown Prince of Crime, Harley was always sad and depressed deep down (simply better at controlling her insanity than most), and that he himself had merely made all her madness rise to the surface. It should be noted, however, that Joker's insanity occasionally induces him to make conclusions that only make sense to him, hence this might not necessarily be the actual case. Harley also displays an extroverted, charismatic and playful attitude. This trait of herself makes capable of befriending almost anyone she meets. She quickly formed a genuine friendship with her teammates of the Suicide Squad, notably Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, and years later with Rick Flag and Bloodsport. She also shows concern about those she sees as her friends, she showed great horror when Captain Boomerang died in a cruel way and mourned Flag's death. She also seems to have some moral standards, she shot and killed Silvio Luna after hearing his capacity of sending children to death. Harley withstands being hit by a car Harley Quinn fights off two thugs at once Harley flips onto the roof of a moving car Harley dual-wielding pistols Harley Quinn as Doctor Harleen Quinzel Harley escapes Renee Montoya's handcuffs Harley fearlessly feeding a hyena Harley Quinn aiming her revolver Harley Quinn using her weaponized javelin  "
https://harleyquinn.fandom.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn	"Harley's psychotic personality was ingrained from her childhood and deepened when she met theJoker, forming an unhealthy attachment to him. With Ivy's intervention, Harley gradually recognizes Joker's abusive behavior towards her, and that she has to be independent to be healthy, manifesting as a desire to join theLegion of Doom. However, ""Being Harley Quinn"" reveals Joker to be rooted deep in her subconscious, meaning that her attempts to prove herself independent were subconsciously motivated by a desire to prove herself to him; his influence over Harley is so powerful that she relapses after joining the L.O.D., which alienates her allies. Harley's obsession with Joker is broken for good after he murdersIvyright in front of her. Despite this, Harley instantly recognizes a ""normal"" Joker in ""All the Best Inmates Have Daddy Issues"", although after she pushed him in acid to restore his memory, they act more like squabbling siblings, as Harley is no longer interested in him romantically, having fallen in love with Ivy instead. All throughout this progression, however, she remains insane, only limiting herself from killing random innocents. Throughout the first season, Harley struggled with figuring out who she really is, while in the second season the focus is on figuring out what she really wants. Harley is impulsive and reactive, and most of her decisions are based on other people, whether it be for Joker's approval or the respect of other villains; the results are messes that someone else, mainly Ivy, must clean up. Harley eventually comprehends this, culminating with her decliningDarkseid's offer to rule the Earth — her desire is Ivy's love, not conquest. She starts to be proactive in fixing her own messes which she demonstrates by not wanting to involve Ivy during ""Dye Hard"", freeing theJustice Leaguein ""A Fight Worth Fighting For"", and trying to save Ivy's wedding in ""Something Borrowed, Something Green"". Despite everything, she is a caring and supportive friend. When Ivy was engaged with Kite-Man she tried with all her effort to not get in the middle, respecting Ivy's decision and worked hard to make sure they can be happy together, planning an extremely detailed bachelorette party for Ivy and even after the wedding ended up in a disaster due to Gordon's attempt to arrest everyone in that place Harley proposed to the couple be herself the one in charge to marry them. During the third season, Harley learns to function in a health romantic relationship with mutual support, honesty, and agency. During an adventure in Batman's mindscape, she finds appeal in being on the side of good.[7]After Ivy assures her that having different goals doesn't mean they will lose each other, Harley gives up villainy to join theBat Family. She also rediscovers her love of psychology as she offers to continue be Bruce Wayne's therapist during his time in prison.[8] In that season, Harley's lack of a verbal filter seems even more pronounced around Ivy. Harley doesn't shy away from recounting her love triangle with Ivy and Kite Man[6], is willing to disclose her sexual history to Ivy ""from grossest to hottest"",[9]and PDA after saying ""I'm gonna need to change my shorts!"".[10]In the fourth season, Harley struggles in her relationship with Ivy since they're now working in different sides, with Harley as the newest member of theBat Familyand Ivy as theLegion of DoomCEO. While she works hard to be a crimefighter some of her villain traits still remain intact, like when she killsProfessor Pygto saveNightwing. Despite this she acts more for others rather than for selfish motives, helping her new teammates to learn how to fight without their gears and searching for anything that makes them earn money. WhenBatgirldisappears, Harley immediately rushes to find her showing how much she cares for her partners. At the end of season 4, following the discover that she was the one who killedNightwing, Harley doubts if she is able of being a crimefighter alongside the Bat Family, thinking that in the end she's a villain at her core, so she decides to quit the Bat Family. After Barbara was shot byJoker, Harley goes for revenge, broking intoBethany's Housekidnapping and torturing Joker to avenge her friend. When Joker asks Harley if she's good or bad, she only responds that she's ""in the middle"", but is not entirely sure. Later, while attending toLex Luthor's birthday party at the moon, to help Ivy in her plan to kill Luthor, thanks to the support of her girlfriend she realizes she is neither good or bad, but instead in the middle is ""in the outside"", capable of doing heroic actions while using her traits as a villain, something she demonstrates by being worried at the people of the buildings Ivy wants to destroy but being fine with those actions, and also savingSupermanafter seeing he was kidnapped and used as a lab rat by Luthor leaving him on a deteriorated state, while they were destroying Luthor's base on the moon. After this she comes to the conclusion she is more than just the lables of ""hero"" or ""villain"", and instead she's ""Harley Quinn"", someone who wishes to help others and those she cares about acting less heroic, capable of doing questionable acts, but is not evil, thus becoming an anti-hero.

https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(DC_Super_Hero_Girls_2019)	During a fight between the Super Hero Girls and the Super Villain Girls, Harley is confronted by Batgirl who was defending her friends. Suddenly, the team was teleported and rescued by Lex Luthor, so they can join the Legion of Doom alongside him and other villains. It's then that Lex tells his team that he has the power to get rid of the superheroes by using Cythonna's amulet to lock them in the Phantom Zone. Harley Quinn, along with Catwoman, confront Blue Beetle who locks him in the Phantom Zone. Lex and the Legion of Doom seek to take over the world using Cythonna's power, something that makes Harley realize that the Legion was going too far. And after seeing how they were getting rid of the Justice League, she then secretly decides to help Wonder Woman escape the Hall of Doom, and resigned from the team and reunited with Batgirl. Harleen and Batgirl reunite with the rest of the girls after receiving a Bumblebee's emergency call. Green Lantern, Supergirl, and Zatanna are initially wary of Harleen, believing she is with the Legion, but she and Batgirl nonetheless assure them that she's not with anybody. Bumblebee then admits she was fine and that she faked the emergency to get them together, and gives them a motivating speech, encouraging them to team up again to save the world and defeat the Legion of Doom. For her part, Harleen retires and leaves the girls behind, claiming that she isn't interested in saving the world. However, Bumblebee's speech made Harley Quinn change her mind, so she went back to help the girls and the other superheroes; surprising Lex Luthor whom she knocks out with her mallet, defeating him. When Supergirl defeated Cythonna by enclosing her in another Kryptonian crystal and along with Zatanna banished her to another dimension of the Multiverse, the Super Hero Girls share a victory hug, including the now-reformed Harley, whom they accept on their team.
