 Look, sorry about before
 I had to make these jerks think I was on their side
 So I could bring them here and wrap them up for you, so you can get on with your plan
 Pammy, honey, you gotta give up this crazy plan
 It's really, really nutsoid
 Please don't turn us all into veggie people
 Gotta be another way
 You're tampering with things man was never meant to know
 I'm sure I could put in a good word for you at your trial, cause after all, your heart's in the right place
 Even if you did kill all those people, but please give up your plan
 Pammy, sweetie, honey, baby, please, please, please give up your plan
 Concentrated weed killer
 I always keep some on hand since the lollipop incident
 I thought we were friends
 Red, friends don't let friends kill 7 billion people
 Smart enough to take away your spanking stick
 Pretty cool, huh
 That's for saving whales, moron
 Anything's better than turning us all into walking brussels sprouts
 I can do this all night
 I don't have that kind of time
